# Bus-Ticket-Booking-using-Python
 Below is a simple Python code for a bus ticket booking mini project. This code allows users to book tickets, view available seats, and display a booking summary. It uses a list to represent the available seats and a dictionary to store booking information.
Here's how the program works:
It initializes with 10 available seats.
Users can choose to display available seats, book tickets, view booking summary, or exit the program.
When booking tickets, users enter their name and the number of tickets they want to book. The program checks if there are enough available seats and proceeds with the booking if possible.
Booking information is stored in the bookings dictionary.
